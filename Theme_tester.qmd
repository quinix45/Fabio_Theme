## Original Quarto Reveal Demo

Original demo for a Quarto Reveal presentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/#/title-slide](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/#/title-slide){target="blank"}

</br>

The current theme adds some useful features implemented with much help from 
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com){target="blank"} (I am no web developer ðŸ¤·)

</br>

I also plan on adding more and more features as the need presents itself! Or, if you have any suggestions, let me know here: 


## Changing the Theme Color

The minimalist style of the theme is intended to accommodate multiple theme colors. The theme color can be easily modified:

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

:::col

<center>

Open the **Fabio_theme.scss** file.

&#8595;

Find and edit the value of the **$theme-color:** variable with the desired theme color. Save. 

&#8595;

Render .qmd file. 

</center>


**Note:** other global variables such as font and font size can also be changed in the same way.

:::col

<center>

A video of how to change the theme color can be found at the following link:

## Zoomable Images  

Tired of hearing that your figures are too small to read?? Custom JS zoom options for figures on **left-click**! To reset to original position, **right-click** on image.


:::{layout-ncol="2"}

:::col

![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="20%"}     
:::


:::col

**Note:** Using .absolute to position images will interfere with the zoom feature. If zoom function is needed, I recommend creating an absolutely position div and place the image inside it like so:

</br>

```html
<div style="position: absolute; top:60%; left:50%;">
![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="30%"}
</div>
```

:::

:::

![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="20%"} 

<!-- to absolutely set images without interfering with zoom option -->

<div style="position: absolute; top:60%; left:50%;">
![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="30%"}
</div>

## Drag Images After Zoom

Add the **.draggable** class to an image to be allowed to move the image after zoom. Useful if the presenter wants to present 2 images side by side!

```html
![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="40%" .draggable} 
```



:::{layout-ncol="2"}

:::col

![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="40%" .draggable} 


![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/avg_plot.png){width="40%" .draggable} 

:::


:::col

Result after manually dragging the two images side by side:

![](Fabio_theme/theme_images/side_by_side_drag.png)
